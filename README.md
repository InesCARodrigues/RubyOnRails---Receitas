<h1>Welcome to my first Ruby on Rails Application! :)</h1>

So I've decided that it was time to step up and started learning new things!
Since I love web development, Ruby on Rails was a logical and easy  choice.

<h2>About this App</h2>
It will be a recipes network. Where members can post their favorite recipes, comment and share.
Like a culinary comunity online. 

<h2>More about the project</h2>
  -I'm developing it on the Cloud9 IDE (c9.io)<br>
  -I'm using Bootstrap-sass for the front end (you can get it here: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass )<br>
  -I'm using Ruby on the Rails framework for back end programming (and it's awesome!)<br><br>

<b>Warning: </b> This is not meant to be anything serious. I'm making this for my personal enjoyment ^_^ 
I'll deploy the app on Heroku soon and share here the link.

If you have any suggestion send me a message, I'm all ears. Thank you all.
